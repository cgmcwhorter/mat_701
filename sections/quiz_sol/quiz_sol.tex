% Q15
\begin{quizsol}
Suppose that $f: [0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ is measurable and $\int_{[0,\infty)} f < \infty$. Is it true that $\int_{[k,\infty)} f(x) \; dx \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$? 
\end{quizsol}

\pf Let $f_k:= f \chi_{[k,\infty)}$. Then goes to $0$ as $k \to \infty$ and $f$ dominates $f_k$ and $f_k \to 0$. 


Another idea: $f \chi_{(0,k)} \nearrow f$ by MCT, $\int \chi_{(0,k)} f \to \int f$. 


Or 

$R(f,E)$ has finite measure, have nested subsets from $k$ to infinite areas, nested, contained, measure sets tend to measusre of intersection which is 0? 













% Quiz16
\begin{quizsol}
Suppose that $f: \R \to \R$ is measurable and the function $g(x,y)= f(x)f(y)^2$ is integrable on $\R^2$. Is $f$ integrable on $\R^2$, i.e. is $f \in L^1(\R)$?
\end{quizsol}

\pf We do indeed have $f \in L^1(\R)$. The function given by $x \mapsto f(x)f(y)^2$ is integrable a.e. on $y$. There are two cases: $f(y)=0$ for almost all $y$ or there exists $y$ such that $f$ is integrable and $f(y) \neq 0$. In either case, $f$ is integrable. \qed \\

% This needs to be cleaned up.
