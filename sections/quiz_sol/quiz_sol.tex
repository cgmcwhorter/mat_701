\begin{quizsol}
Suppose that $f: [0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ is measurable and $\int_{[0,\infty)} f < \infty$. Is it true that $\int_{[k,\infty)} f(x) \; dx \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$? 
\end{quizsol}

\pf Let $f_k:= f \chi_{[k,\infty)}$. Then goes to $0$ as $k \to \infty$ and $f$ dominates $f_k$ and $f_k \to 0$. 


Another idea: $f \chi_{(0,k)} \nearrow f$ by MCT, $\int \chi_{(0,k)} f \to \int f$. 


Or 

$R(f,E)$ has finite measure, have nested subsets from $k$ to infinite areas, nested, contained, measure sets tend to measusre of intersection which is 0?
