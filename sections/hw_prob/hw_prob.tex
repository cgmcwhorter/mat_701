is measurable and $|A|<\infty$. \\

Prove that the set
        \[
        A = \{ x \in [0, 1] \colon \forall q \in \N \ \exists p \in \N \text{ such that } |x-p/q| \leq 1/q^2 \}
        \]

\begin{hw} \label{hw:8}
Given a continuous function $f \colon \R^n \to \R^n$, define $\mathcal{M}= \{ E \subset \R^n \colon f^{-1}(E) \text{ is Borel} \}$. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Prove that $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.
	\item Prove that if $E$ is Borel, then $f^{-1}(E)$ is Borel. [\emph{Hint: Use (a).}] \\
	\end{enumerate}
\end{hw}


% HW 9
\begin{hw} \label{hw:9}
Suppose $f \colon \R \to \R$ is a function with a continuous derivative. Prove that for every measurable set $E$, the set $f(E)$ is also measurable. [\emph{Hint: although $f$ need not be Lipschitz, its restriction to any bounded interval is Lipschitz.}] \\

% HW 11
\begin{hw} \label{hw:11}
Show that there exists a nested sequence of sets $E_1 \supset E_2 \supset \cdots$ such that 
$\ext{E_1}< \infty$ and $\bigcap_{k=1}^\infty E_k= \emptyset$ but $\ds\lim_{k \to \infty } \ext{E_k}> 0$; that is, outer measure is not continuous under nested intersections. [\emph{Hint: Use the translates of the Vitali set.}] \\

\noindent\emph{Remark: This shows that having $|E|>0$ is not necessary for $E-E$ to contain a neighborhood of $0$.} \\

% HW 18 
\begin{hw} \label{hw:18}
Suppose $\phi: [0, \infty )\to [0, \infty)$ is a function such that $\phi(t) \to 0$ as $t \to \infty$. Consider a sequence of measurable functions $\{f_k\}$, $f_k: \R^n \to \R$, such that $|f_k(x)| \leq \phi(|x|)$ for every $k$, and $f_k \to f$ a.e.. Prove that the conclusion of Egorov's Theorem holds in this situation; that is, for every $\ep>0$, there exists a closed set $E(\ep) \subset \R^n$ such that $|\R^n \setminus E(\ep)| < \ep$ and $f_k \to f$ uniformly on $E(\ep)$. [\emph{Hint: Follow the proof of Egorov's theorem.}] \\
\end{hw}


% HW 19
\begin{hw} \label{hw:19}
