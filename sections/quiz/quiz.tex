% Quiz: What if we require this for measurable $A$ only? That is, what if A only splits measurable sets into the inequality. Answer is yes. This is found via the proof of Caratheodory THeorem. TO be specific, let quiz problem ineq be star. So if E satisfies * for all measurable sets A, then it satisfies star for all sets A. 

% pf: Given arb A, let K \supset A be G_\delta set, |K|_e = |A|_e. Did not change right hand side, left hand inequality side could only go up. We know star holds for K, so star holds for A. 



% quiz
% Let $f(x)= \sin(1/x)$ for $x \neq 0$ and $f(0)=0$. Claim $f$ is upper semicontinuous on $\R$.
% No: Take horizontal line above y=0, suppose to cover chunk around 0 but does not, so not usc. To make usc, would need to be 1 or bigger at x=0 for usc. 






% quiz
% Suppose $f: \R \to \R$ is measurable. Define
%	\[
%	g(x)=
%	\begin{cases}
%	|f(x)|, & |f(x)| \geq 1 \\
%	0, & \text{otherwise}
%	\end{cases}
%	\]
%Claim that $g$ is measurable function on $\R$.

% $g= f \cdot \chi_{\{ |f| \geq 1\}}$ so measurable.another is piece by piece: $E= \{|f| \geq 1\}$. now g measurable on E. g|_{E^C} is measurable since 0 there. \{g>a\}= \{g|_E>a} \cup {g_{E^C}>a}$.. Or g= \phi \circ f, there phi horizontal line segment -1 to 1 at 0, open circles, then y=x elsewhere, so that measurable, Borel measurable. 





% Quiz 
% Let f(x)=1$ if $x \in \Q$ and $f(x)=0$ otherwise. Claim $f$ is measurable function on $\R$. 

% \{f>a\}=\Q or \R and both measurable. So true.







% f: \R \to \R by f(x)=\sin(x^2)$. Claim $f$ is Lipschitz. 



% Quiz
% Suppose $A_1 \supset A_2 \supset A_4 \supset \cdots$ is a nested sequence of measurable subsets of $\R^n$ such that $|A_1|<\infty$. Claim $|A_k \sm A_{k+1}| \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$. 

% True: |A_k| - |A_{k+1}| and |A_k| \to |\cap A_j| by limit properties, converge to diff to 0. or could do by
% Contradiction: Measure intersection finite, so convergent sequence real numbers, then to 0 by cauchy criterion.
% or A_1 = (A_1\sm A_2) \cup (A_2 \sm A_3) \cup \cdots and use countable additivity, ie.. $\sum |A_k \sm A_{k+1}| = |\cup (A_k \sm A_{k+1}| \leq |A_1|<\infty. 









% Quiz 1

%Claim: $A \subset [0,1]$, $A \neq [0,1]$, $A$ closed, claim $\ext{A}<1$.
%proper subset so complement open so exists open interval and can take off the measure of that interval. \ext{A} < (x-\ep) + (1-(x+\ep)), given that $A \subset [0,x-\ep] \cup [x+\ep,1]$. 

% Quiz 2: A \supset \R set with A \cap [-k,k] measurable for all $k \in \N$. Is $A$ measurable? Yes, countable union of measurable sets is measurable. 


% Why cant one cover a closed disk by closed intervals? \subset \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k
% then \sum_{k=1}^\infty \nu(I_k) > \pi r^2














% Quiz missing class 1
%Quiz: Suppose $A \subset \R$ is measurable set. Claim for all $\ep>0$, there is a compact set $K \subset A$ such that $\ext{A \sm K}<\ep$. 

%No: $\R$ is measurable, $K$ interval. $|\R \sm k|=\infty$ for all compact sets.
